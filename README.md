üöÄ DevOps End-to-End Pipeline on Azure

‚¶Å	This project showcases a complete DevOps lifecycle ‚Äî from building the infrastructure to automating deployment and monitoring.
‚¶Å	It reflects my hands-on experience in creating a fully automated, cloud-native environment using Azure services and modern DevOps tools.




üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

‚¶Å	The system was designed with a modular structure that combines infrastructure, automation, CI/CD, and monitoring layers ‚Äî all working together to ensure scalability, security, and reliability.





üîπ Infrastructure

‚¶Å	The foundation was built using Terraform, where I provisioned all resources on Azure:
‚¶Å	A Resource Group to organize everything.
‚¶Å	A Managed Disk for persistent storage.
‚¶Å	An AKS Cluster to host both the frontend and backend containers.




üê≥ Container Registry
‚¶Å	All Docker images for the applications were built and pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR), which serves as the central image store before deployment to AKS.



‚öôÔ∏è Automation & CI/CD

1.	To automate the entire workflow, I used a combination of:
2.	GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
3.	SonarQube to maintain code quality.
4.	Ansible for configuration management and automating post-deployment tasks.






‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Cluster (AKS)

‚¶Å	Inside the AKS cluster, I deployed:
‚¶Å	Frontend Application
‚¶Å	Backend Application
‚¶Å	MSSQL Database
‚¶Å	Each service was containerized and connected securely within the cluster.





üìä Monitoring & Alerting

1.	Observability was a major focus in this project. I integrated:
2.	Prometheus for metrics collection.
3.	Grafana for dashboard visualization.
4.	Alertmanager for notifications.
5.	Slack & Call Me Bot to receive real-time alerts whenever issues occurred.





üîÅ Continuous Delivery (GitOps)

‚¶Å	To ensure the deployed state always matches the Git configuration, I used Argo CD.
‚¶Å	This GitOps approach made deployments traceable, consistent, and easy to roll back when needed.

üß† Key Learnings

1.	Working on this project taught me how to bring all DevOps tools together to form a complete automated ecosystem.
I learned how to:

2.	Manage infrastructure as code with Terraform.

3.	Automate build and deploy pipelines using GitHub Actions.

4.	Apply GitOps principles with Argo CD.

5.	Monitor clusters using Prometheus & Grafana.

6.	Use Ansible for automated configurations.

7.	Integrate real-time alerts into Slack for proactive response.
